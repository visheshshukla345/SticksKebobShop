# Sticks Kebob Shop Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
In this project, I conducted an in-depth customer segmentation analysis for Sticks Kebob Shop to provide strategic recommendations for understanding and expanding their customer base. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into how people choose which fast-food restaurants to visit, with a specific focus on Sticks Kebob Shop. I considered critical factors like location, price, menu variety, and cuisine preferences, to identify key segments and devise a plan for the company's growth.

## Objectives
- Understand Sticks Kebob Shop's customer base and their motivations.
- Distinguish between customers and non-customers.
- Identify the most relevant questions for segmenting customers.
- Estimate the number of customer segments using statistical methods.
- Create detailed profiles of each segment.
- Recommend which segments Sticks Kebob Shop should target.
- Propose an ideal location for the next Sticks restaurant.
